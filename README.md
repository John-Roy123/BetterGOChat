## To Run

CD into the project folder and run the following, depending on whether you want a client or a server instance: 
```
go run main.go client|server
```
From there, you will be prompted to enter the server IP, which will be in the server console log. Enter the server IP as such: xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:8080 to connect to the server on port 8080 after that, enter your username and you will join the server!
